> Comparison of PostgreSQL HA Kubernetes Operators

This repository functions as a comparison of different Kubernetes Operators for PostgreSQL High Availability.

The operators that will be covered are, so far:

- [Zalando Postgres Operator](https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator)
- [CrunchyData Postgres Operator](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator)
- [StackGres](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres)
- [KubeDB Operator](https://github.com/kubedb/operator)

These are the planned steps:

- [ ] Document a typical database lifecyle
- [ ] Define show cases or tasks of that lifecycle to contain in the comparison
- [ ] Document a local setup for each operator based on `kind` or `minikube`
- [ ] Document the execution of each defined show case or task for each operator
- [ ] Create a data-driven comparison
